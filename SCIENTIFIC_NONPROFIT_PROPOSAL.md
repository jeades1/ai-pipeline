## The Critical Gap in Medical Discovery

### Current State: Fragmented and Inefficient Research Ecosystem

#### Institutional Data Silos
- **350+ major medical centers** worldwide operate in isolation
- **95% of medical data** remains trapped within individual institutions
- **Rare disease research** severely limited by small sample sizes
- **Biomarker discovery** constrained by single-institution populations

#### Privacy Barriers Preventing Collaboration
- **HIPAA compliance** prevents meaningful data sharing
- **International regulations** (GDPR, etc.) create additional barriers
- **Institutional liability concerns** discourage data collaboration
- **Patient consent complexity** makes multi-site studies prohibitive

#### Resulting Scientific Limitations
- **7-15 years** average time from biomarker discovery to clinical application
- **90% of rare diseases** have no approved treatments
- **$2.6 billion** average cost to develop a new drug
- **Reproducibility crisis**: 70% of medical studies cannot be replicated

### The Cost of Inaction
- **2.8 million** preventable deaths annually from delayed diagnoses
- **$165 billion** in healthcare waste from ineffective treatments
- **30 million people** worldwide with undiagnosed rare diseases
- **Lost scientific potential**: Countless medical breakthroughs never discovered
