# Outdated Files Analysis - September 15, 2025

## Current Status: ✅ Repository is Clean

After comprehensive analysis, the AI Pipeline repository is in excellent condition with minimal outdated content. Here's the complete assessment:

## 🗂️ Files Already Properly Deprecated/Archived

### ✅ **Explicitly Deprecated Files (Properly Handled)**
These files contain deprecation notices and serve as placeholders - **NO ACTION NEEDED**:

1. **`reports/templates/run_report.md.j2`**
   - Status: ✅ Properly deprecated
   - Content: Single line deprecation notice
   - Action: None - serves as placeholder with clear guidance

2. **`conf/experiments/aki_demo.yaml`** 
   - Status: ✅ Properly deprecated
   - Content: Clear deprecation notice with migration guidance
   - Action: None - educational placeholder for users

3. **`benchmarks/aki_markers.json`**
   - Status: ✅ Properly deprecated
   - Content: JSON deprecation notice with alternatives
   - Action: None - clear migration path provided

4. **`benchmarks/aki_markers.tsv`**
   - Status: ✅ Properly deprecated  
   - Content: TSV deprecation notice
   - Action: None - consistent with JSON version

### ✅ **Commercial Content Properly Archived**
All commercial/investment content has been cleanly moved to `archived_commercial/`:
- Revenue projections, investment timelines, market opportunity charts
- Partnership strategies, financial models, executive summaries
- Status: ✅ Clean separation maintained

## 🔧 Minor TODOs in Source Code

### **`src/lincs/reversal.py`** - 2 Development TODOs
```python
# TODO: read metadata file and filter cell_line == "HA1E"  (Line 11)
# TODO: cosine / tau score vs HA1E perturbation signatures  (Line 16)
```

**Assessment**: These are **development notes**, not outdated files. They represent:
- Future enhancement opportunities in LINCS data processing
- Scientific method refinements for drug reversal analysis
- **Recommendation**: Keep as development roadmap items

## 🧹 Repository Cleanliness

### ✅ **No Temporary Files**
- No `.tmp`, `.temp`, `__pycache__`, or `.pyc` files found
- Clean development environment maintained

### ✅ **Well-Organized Structure**
- Generated figures properly organized in `presentation/figures/`
- Archive directories clearly labeled and separated
- Configuration files current and documented

### ✅ **Documentation Current**
- All major analysis documents up-to-date
- Scientific nonprofit materials current (September 2025)
- Technical architecture documentation reflects current state

## 📊 Interactive HTML Files Status

The interactive HTML visualizations contain embedded third-party library code (Plotly.js) with internal deprecation warnings. These are:
- **Normal**: Part of the Plotly.js library internals
- **Not Our Code**: External dependency deprecations
- **No Action Needed**: Will be resolved in future Plotly.js updates

## 🎯 Recommendations

### **No Cleanup Required** 
The repository is in excellent condition with:
1. ✅ Proper deprecation notices where appropriate
2. ✅ Clean separation of commercial vs nonprofit content  
3. ✅ No actual outdated files requiring removal
4. ✅ Clear migration guidance for deprecated components

### **Optional Enhancements** (Not Urgent)
1. **Complete LINCS TODOs** when enhancing drug reversal analysis
2. **Update Plotly.js** in future releases to resolve library deprecations
3. **Consider archiving** some older analysis documents if desired

## 🏆 Repository Quality Score: A+

**Summary**: Your AI Pipeline repository demonstrates excellent maintenance practices with proper deprecation handling, clean file organization, and up-to-date scientific nonprofit positioning. No immediate cleanup actions are required.
