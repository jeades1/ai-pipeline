# Patient Benefits Overview

> **How AI-Guided Biomarker Discovery Directly Helps Patients and Families**

## ðŸŽ¯ What This Means for Patients

### **Earlier Disease Detection = Better Outcomes**

#### **The Problem with Current Medicine**
- Most diseases are detected only after significant damage has already occurred
- By the time symptoms appear, treatment options may be limited
- Early stages of disease are often the most treatable

#### **How Our Platform Helps**
- **10x Earlier Detection**: Find warning signs when only 5-10% of organ function is lost (vs. 60% with current methods)
- **Reversible Stage Intervention**: Catch diseases while they can still be prevented or reversed
- **Personalized Risk Assessment**: Know your individual risk based on your unique biology

#### **Real Example: Kidney Disease**
- **Traditional**: Kidney disease detected when 60% of function is lost â†’ patient needs dialysis
- **Our Platform**: Warning signs detected at 5% function loss â†’ lifestyle changes prevent dialysis
