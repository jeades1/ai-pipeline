# Methodology: Metrics and Assessments

> **For Non-Technical Audiences**: This document explains how we measure the success and quality of our AI biomarker discovery system. Think of it as our "report card" - we use specific tests and metrics to prove our system works better than existing methods.

## Understanding Our Measurement Approach

### **Why Measurement Matters**
Just like a new medical device needs rigorous testing before use in hospitals, our AI system requires comprehensive evaluation to ensure it delivers real clinical value. We use multiple types of measurements to assess different aspects of performance.

## 1) Platform Precision/Ranking Metrics

### **What These Measure**
How accurately our system identifies and ranks potential biomarkers compared to known successful biomarkers.

### **Key Metrics Explained**

#### **Precision@K (K âˆˆ {5,10,20,50,100})**
- **What it means**: If we look at the top K biomarkers our system recommends, how many are actually good?
- **Example**: Precision@10 = 80% means 8 out of our top 10 recommendations are clinically useful
- **Why it matters**: Higher precision means doctors can trust our recommendations

#### **Recall@K**
- **What it means**: Of all the good biomarkers that exist for a disease, how many do we find in our top K?
- **Example**: Recall@50 = 90% means we find 90% of all good biomarkers when looking at our top 50 candidates
- **Why it matters**: Higher recall means we don't miss important biomarkers

#### **Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR)**
- **What it means**: On average, how high do we rank the really good biomarkers?
- **Example**: MRR = 0.5 means good biomarkers typically appear in our top 2 recommendations
- **Why it matters**: Better ranking means less time wasted on poor candidates

#### **NDCG@K (Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain)**
- **What it means**: How well do we prioritize the best biomarkers at the top of our list?
- **Why it matters**: Clinical teams want the best candidates first to maximize their research time

#### **Hit@K**
- **What it means**: What percentage of our top K lists contain at least one good biomarker?
- **Why it matters**: Ensures our system consistently finds something useful

### **Data Sources**
- **Inputs**: `artifacts/*/promoted.tsv` (our recommendations), `benchmarks/aki_markers.json` (known good biomarkers)
- **Benchmarks**: Established lists of validated biomarkers for different diseases

## 2) Experimental Rigor (Objective Proxies)

### **What This Measures**
The sophistication and reliability of our experimental approach, rated on a 0-10 scale for each dimension.

### **Key Dimensions**

#### **Experimental Integration (0-10 scale)**
- **What it measures**: Number of different experimental techniques we can integrate (ELISA, scRNA, proteomics, tissue chips, imaging)
- **Why it matters**: More techniques = more comprehensive understanding = more reliable biomarkers
- **Target**: 8+ (world-class integration across multiple technologies)

#### **Mechanistic Understanding (0-10 scale)**
- **What it measures**: Percentage of our biomarker recommendations that have proven cause-effect relationships
- **Example**: 7/10 means 70% of our biomarkers have mechanistic explanations
- **Why it matters**: Understanding mechanisms helps predict how biomarkers will behave in different patients

#### **Clinical Translation (0-10 scale)**
- **What it measures**: Number of our biomarkers that have been validated in actual patients
- **Why it matters**: Lab success doesn't always translate to clinical success
- **Target**: Steady progression from lab validation to clinical implementation

#### **Data Scale (0-10 scale)**
- **What it measures**: Amount of high-quality, well-documented data we can analyze
- **Why it matters**: More data = more reliable patterns = better biomarker discovery
- **Quality focus**: Not just quantity, but data with proper documentation and quality control

#### **Validation Throughput (0-10 scale)**
- **What it measures**: How many experiments we can run per week with our automated systems
- **Why it matters**: Faster validation = faster discovery = faster benefit to patients
- **Target**: High throughput without sacrificing quality

### **Scoring Methodology**
Each metric has a count-based foundation (actual numbers) that gets normalized to 0-10 for fair comparison across different dimensions.

## 3) Competitive Comparison (Outcome-Based)

### **How We Compare to Other Systems**

#### **Benchmark Performance**
- **Precision@K across diseases**: Compare our accuracy to other biomarker discovery methods
- **Disease Coverage**: Number of diseases we can effectively analyze vs competitors
- **Time-to-Validation**: How quickly we can validate new biomarkers vs traditional methods

#### **Real-World Performance**
- **False Discovery Rate**: How often our predictions turn out to be wrong in clinical testing
- **Prospective Validation Success**: Performance on new, unseen patient data
- **Clinical Adoption**: How readily healthcare systems adopt our biomarkers

#### **Commercial Validation**
- **Partnerships**: Collaborations with healthcare systems and pharmaceutical companies
- **Pilot Programs**: Successful implementation in real clinical settings
- **Revenue Generation**: Market validation of our approach
