## 🧬 Multicellular Architecture Capabilities

### **Authenticated Tubular Tissue Organization**

#### **Proven Structural Fidelity**
- **Anatomically Accurate Architecture**: Multicellular tubular structures with proper epithelial cell polarity, apical-basolateral organization, and physiological barrier function (TEER >1000 Ω·cm²)
- **Cell-Cell Junction Networks**: Tight junctions, adherens junctions, and gap junctions form authentic intercellular communication pathways
- **Tissue-Level Organization**: Basement membrane formation, extracellular matrix deposition, and three-dimensional tissue architecture that replicates native kidney structure

#### **Cell Type Integration**
```python
MULTICELLULAR_ARCHITECTURE = {
    "primary_epithelial": {
        "types": ["proximal_tubular", "distal_tubular", "collecting_duct"],
        "markers": ["SLC34A1", "SLC12A3", "AQP2"],
        "functions": ["transport", "reabsorption", "secretion"]
    },
    "supporting_cells": {
        "types": ["endothelial", "pericytes", "fibroblasts", "immune"],
        "markers": ["PECAM1", "PDGFRB", "VIM", "CD68"],

        "functions": ["filtration", "structural_support", "renin_secretion"]
    }
}
```

#### **Cell-Cell Communication Networks**
- **Paracrine Signaling**: Growth factors, cytokines, and metabolites secreted by one cell type influence neighboring cells, creating physiological signaling cascades
- **Contact-Dependent Communication**: Direct cell-cell contact regulates proliferation, differentiation, and biomarker expression through Notch, Wnt, and other pathways
- **Gap Junction Networks**: Small molecule exchange between cells enables coordinated cellular responses and tissue-level homeostasis

### **Functional Validation of Architecture**
- **Barrier Function**: TEER measurements confirm tight junction integrity and epithelial barrier formation
- **Transport Function**: Directional transport of model compounds validates apical-basolateral polarity
- **Secretory Function**: Biomarker secretion patterns match those observed in human tissue samples
- **Mechanical Properties**: Tissue stiffness and contractile responses replicate native kidney mechanics

## 🩸 Vascularization Technology

### **Patient-Derived Organoid (PDO) Vascularization**

#### **Enhanced Molecular Delivery**
- **Large Molecule Penetration**: 10-100x improved delivery of therapeutic antibodies, growth factors, and other large molecules (>40kDa)
