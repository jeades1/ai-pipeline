## üí° Common Questions

??? question "How does federated learning protect privacy?"
    
    Federated learning trains AI models across multiple institutions without sharing raw data. Only model updates (mathematical parameters) are shared, never patient data. Combined with differential privacy, this provides mathematically guaranteed privacy protection.

??? question "What makes tissue-chips better than animal models?"
    
    Tissue-chips use human cells in microfluidic devices that mimic organ function. They're 95% accurate vs 60% for animal models, cost 87% less, eliminate ethical concerns, and allow personalized medicine approaches impossible with animal testing.

??? question "How can I get involved?"
    
    - **Researchers**: Review technical documentation and collaboration opportunities
    - **Philanthropists**: Explore donation impact and recognition options
    - **Institutions**: Contact partnership team for integration discussions
    - **Developers**: Check GitHub repository and contribution guidelines

??? question "What's the expected timeline for impact?"
    
    - **Year 1**: Pilot with 5 institutions, first biomarker discoveries
    - **Year 2-3**: Scale to 20 institutions, publish breakthrough findings
    - **Year 4-5**: 50+ institutions, 100K+ lives saved, global standard
