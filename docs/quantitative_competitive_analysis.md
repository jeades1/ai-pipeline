# Quantitative Competitive Analysis Framework

## Current Problem
Both capabilities matrix and experimental rigor use subjective 1-10 scores with no benchmarks.

## Proposed Objective Metrics

### 1. Platform Performance Benchmarks
Instead of subjective capability scores, measure actual performance:

```python
# Quantitative platform comparison
platforms = {
    'Our Platform': {
        'benchmark_precision_at_10': 0.0,        # Current AKI P@10
        'diseases_validated': 1,                 # AKI only
        'clinical_trials_enabled': 0,           # None yet
        'peer_reviewed_publications': 0,         # None yet
        'industry_partnerships': 0,              # None yet
        'regulatory_interactions': 0,            # FDA/EMA meetings
    },
    'Recursion Pharma': {
        'benchmark_precision_at_10': 0.15,       # Estimated from publications
        'diseases_validated': 8,                 # Multiple therapeutic areas
        'clinical_trials_enabled': 4,           # Programs in trials
        'peer_reviewed_publications': 50,        # Nature, Cell, etc.
        'industry_partnerships': 12,             # Pharma collaborations
        'regulatory_interactions': 3,            # FDA meetings
    },
    # ... other platforms
}
```

### 2. Outcome-Based Capability Assessment

Instead of "Data Integration = 7/10", measure:
- **Discovery Efficiency**: Time from data to validated biomarker
- **Clinical Translation Rate**: % of discoveries that reach clinical validation
- **False Discovery Rate**: % of predictions that fail validation
- **Resource Efficiency**: Cost per validated biomarker

### 3. Commercial Readiness Scorecard

Replace product opportunity matrix with:
- **Market Size**: Addressable market for each application area
- **Technical Readiness Level**: 1-9 TRL scale for each capability
- **Competitive Moat**: Patents, data exclusivity, network effects
- **Customer Validation**: Pilot studies, LOIs, revenue

## Implementation
1. **Benchmark Collection**: Gather published performance metrics from competitors
2. **Internal Metrics**: Establish consistent measurement protocols
3. **Third-Party Validation**: Independent evaluation by domain experts
4. **Regular Updates**: Quarterly competitive analysis updates
