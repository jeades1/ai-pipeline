# Benchmarking Harness: How We Measure Success

> **For Non-Technical Audiences**: Think of benchmarking like testing how well our AI system performs compared to existing methods. It's like comparing a new GPS navigation system to see if it actually gets you to your destination faster and more reliably than the old paper maps.

## What is Benchmarking and Why Does It Matter?

### **The Challenge**
When developing any AI system for healthcare, we need to prove it's actually better than what doctors are currently using. It's not enough to say "our system is great" - we need numbers that prove it.

### **Our Approach: Rigorous Testing**
We test our biomarker discovery system against established benchmarks (known "correct answers") to measure:

- **Precision**: When our system says "this is a good biomarker," how often is it right?
- **Recall**: Of all the good biomarkers that exist, how many does our system find?
- **Reliability**: Does our system give consistent results when tested multiple times?

## How Our Benchmarking Works

### **Technical Implementation**
- **Script**: `benchmarks/run_benchmarks.py`
- **Inputs**:
  - `artifacts/promoted.tsv` — produced by your pipeline run
  - `data/benchmarks/*.tsv` — list(s) of known biomarkers for a given context
- **Metrics**: precision@k, recall@k with 95% bootstrap CIs
- **Output**: `artifacts/bench/benchmark_report.json`

### **What This Means in Practice**
**Precision@10 = 80%** means: "If our system recommends the top 10 biomarkers, 8 of them will actually be clinically useful"

**Recall@50 = 90%** means: "If there are 100 good biomarkers for a disease, our system will find 90 of them when looking at the top 50 candidates"

**Bootstrap Confidence Intervals** means: "We run the test many times to ensure results are reliable, not just lucky"

## Running the Benchmarks

### **Simple Command**
```bash
make bench-run
```

### **What Happens Behind the Scenes**
1. **System Analysis**: Our AI analyzes the biological data and ranks potential biomarkers
2. **Comparison**: We compare our rankings against known successful biomarkers
3. **Statistical Testing**: We calculate performance metrics with confidence intervals
4. **Report Generation**: Creates a detailed report showing exactly how well the system performed

## Performance Standards

### **Industry Benchmarks**
- **Traditional Methods**: 60-70% precision, 40-50% recall
- **Best-in-Class Systems**: 75-85% precision, 60-70% recall
- **Our Target**: >85% precision, >75% recall

### **Clinical Translation**
- **Research Phase**: Precision >70% acceptable for initial screening
- **Clinical Validation**: Precision >85% required for clinical trials
- **Clinical Implementation**: Precision >90% required for routine patient care

## Why This Matters for Different Audiences

### **For Healthcare Providers**
- **Confidence**: Know that the biomarkers recommended have been rigorously tested
- **Risk Assessment**: Understand the likelihood that recommendations will be clinically useful
- **Implementation Planning**: Use performance data to plan integration with clinical workflows

### **For Researchers**
- **Validation**: Proof that the system performs better than existing methods
- **Methodology**: Understanding of how performance is measured and validated
- **Collaboration**: Baseline for comparing against other research approaches

### **For Patients**
- **Trust**: Assurance that the system has been thoroughly tested before clinical use
- **Transparency**: Clear understanding of how well the system performs
- **Safety**: Knowledge that multiple layers of validation protect against errors
