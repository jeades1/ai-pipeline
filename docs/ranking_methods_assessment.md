# Ranking Methods: Gold Standard Assessment

## Learning-to-Rank (LTR) Methods

### **Current Status: Industry Standard, Not Gold Standard**

**What we're using:**
- Pointwise LTR (LogisticRegression): Treats ranking as binary classification
- Basic KG features: degree, PageRank, pathway membership

**Industry Gold Standards:**
1. **LambdaRank/LambdaMART**: Used by Microsoft Bing, pairwise ranking with gradient boosting
2. **RankNet**: Neural network approach, used by major search engines
3. **ListNet/ListMLE**: Listwise ranking that considers entire ranked lists
4. **XGBoost Ranking**: Modern gradient boosting with ranking objectives

### **Progression Path to Gold Standard**

**Current (Basic)**: Pointwise ranking
- Treats each gene independently
- Simple logistic regression
- Limited feature engineering

**Next Step (Good)**: Pairwise ranking  
- RankSVM or XGBoost with ranking objective
- Considers relative ordering between genes
- Better handles ranking-specific loss functions

**Gold Standard (Advanced)**: Listwise + Deep Learning
- LambdaRank with gradient boosting
- Neural ranking models (e.g., RankNet)
- Learning-to-rank with attention mechanisms
- Cross-domain transfer learning

## Feature Engineering Status

### **Current Features: Basic but Relevant**
- Statistical scores (effect size, p-value)
- Network centrality (PageRank, degree)
- Pathway membership

### **Industry Gold Standard Features:**
- **Semantic embeddings**: Gene2Vec, pathway embeddings
- **Multi-scale network features**: Motif counts, clustering coefficients
- **Temporal dynamics**: Time-series features, causal discovery
- **Cross-modal integration**: Text mining + network + experimental
- **Uncertainty quantification**: Bayesian neural networks

## Biomarker Discovery Context

### **Academic/Pharma Gold Standards:**
1. **Google DeepMind**: AlphaFold + experimental validation loops
2. **Recursion Pharma**: High-content imaging + deep learning + experimental validation
3. **Insilico Medicine**: Generative models + clinical trial integration
4. **BenevolentAI**: Knowledge graphs + NLP + clinical reasoning

### **Our Position:**
- **Feature engineering**: Good (multi-modal KG integration)
- **Ranking algorithms**: Basic → progressing to good
- **Experimental integration**: Early stage but promising architecture
- **Clinical validation**: Planned but not yet implemented

## Recommendation: Progressive Enhancement

**Phase 1 (Current)**: Basic LTR with enhanced features → **Good enough for proof-of-concept**
**Phase 2 (3 months)**: Pairwise ranking + richer features → **Industry competitive**  
**Phase 3 (6 months)**: Listwise + deep learning + uncertainty → **Gold standard**

The key insight: Gold standard in biomarker discovery isn't just about algorithms - it's about **experimental validation loops** and **clinical translation**, which is our architectural advantage.
