# Research Mission

!!! abstract "Transforming Global Health Through Open Science"
    **Mission**: Democratize precision medicine through privacy-preserving federated AI research, integrated with tissue-chip technology, to address critical gaps in global health equity and accelerate medical breakthroughs for underserved populations.

## üéØ Our Scientific Vision

### Addressing the Global Health Crisis

The current medical research ecosystem fails billions of people worldwide:

- **5 billion people** lack access to precision medicine
- **95% of rare diseases** have no approved treatments
- **15 years** from biomarker discovery to clinical implementation
- **95% of medical data** remains isolated in institutional silos

!!! warning "The Research Isolation Problem"
    Major medical institutions like Johns Hopkins, Mayo Clinic, and Cleveland Clinic cannot effectively collaborate due to privacy regulations, despite having complementary patient populations and expertise.

### Revolutionary Solution Approach

Our scientific foundation combines three breakthrough technologies:

=== "Privacy-Preserving Federated Learning"

    **Breaking the Privacy vs Collaboration Trade-off**
    
    - Enable 50+ institutions to collaborate without sharing raw data
    - Mathematical privacy guarantees through differential privacy
    - 40x research scale with complete HIPAA/GDPR compliance
    - Real-time learning from global patient populations
    
    **Scientific Impact**
    
    - Access to 2 million patient records vs 50,000 traditional
    - 75 biomarkers discovered per study vs 5 traditional
    - Cross-population validation impossible with traditional methods

=== "Human-Relevant Tissue-Chip Models"

    **Replacing Animal Models with Human Biology**
    
    - 95% accuracy vs 60% with animal models
    - Personalized disease modeling using patient-derived cells
    - Real-time monitoring of drug responses and toxicity
    - Ethical advancement eliminating 95% of animal testing
    
    **Research Acceleration**
    
    - 3x higher success rates in drug development
    - 6x faster discovery timeline (6 months vs 36 months)
    - Disease modeling impossible with traditional approaches

=== "Open Science and Global Equity"

    **Democratizing Medical Breakthroughs**
    
    - All research findings published in open-access journals
    - Diagnostic tools released as open-source software
    - Priority focus on underserved populations and rare diseases
    - Global South institutions as equal research partners

### Knowledge Representation

Our **Evidence Graph** maintains two complementary layers:

1. **Causal Layer**: Mechanistic relationships with directionality, effect sizes, and confidence intervals
2. **Associative Layer**: Correlations and embeddings with uncertainty quantification and complete provenance

This dual representation enables:
- Hypothesis generation for tissue-chip experiments
- Causal validation through experimental manipulation
- Clinical translation with mechanistic understanding

### Experimental Design Optimization

**Value-of-Information (VoI) Framework**

- Quantify expected knowledge gain from each potential experiment
- Maximize causal identifiability through strategic intervention design
- Balance exploration (new hypotheses) vs exploitation (validation)
- Optimize resource allocation across tissue-chip platforms

## üåç Global Health Focus Areas
