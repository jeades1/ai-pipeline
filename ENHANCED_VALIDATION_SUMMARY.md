# Enhanced Validation Framework

> For medical researchers and clinicians: This document details the evidence ladder, statistical validation, biological and analytical validation, clinical translation criteria, and regulatory mapping used across the platform.

## ðŸŒŸ Enhanced Validation Pipeline Implementation

**New in v2.0**: We have implemented a comprehensive **Enhanced Validation Pipeline** that operationalizes all validation concepts described below. See implementation in `biomarkers/enhanced_validation.py` with key capabilities:

- **Network Propagation Analysis**: Validate biomarkers using biological network connectivity
- **Pathway-Informed Constraints**: Enforce pathway coherence requirements  
- **Multi-Omics Evidence Integration**: Synthesize evidence across omics layers
- **Real-time Validation Monitoring**: Continuous validation assessment
- **Comprehensive Validation Orchestration**: End-to-end validation pipeline

**Quick Start**: `pipeline = EnhancedValidationPipeline(); result = pipeline.validate_biomarker_panel(biomarkers, data)`

## Why an enhanced framework?
Biomarker efforts often fail at prospective validation due to: small/cohort bias, leakage, unstable signals over time, and lack of mechanistic grounding. Our framework combines causal inference, multi-cohort testing, and tissue-chip interventional evidence to reduce false discovery and improve clinical translation.

## Evidence Ladder (E0 â†’ E5)
- E0 â€” Correlation only: Unadjusted associations; exploratory only.
- E1 â€” Temporal precedence + module linkage: Longitudinal ordering; module-level coherence; multiple testing control.
- E2 â€” Interventional causality in vitro: Tissue-chip perturbations (CRISPRi/a, ligand/receptor, drug dosing) change functional readouts consistent with the biomarkerâ€™s mechanism; effect sizes with 95% CIs and replication across runs.
- E3 â€” Cross-model & cross-donor replication: Reproducible effects in â‰¥2 model systems and â‰¥3 donors with heterogeneity modeling; random-effects meta-analytic support.
- E4 â€” Clinical association + mediation via function: Association with outcomes survives adjustment; mediation analysis shows tissue-function mediator carries a significant indirect effect; transport checks from in-vitro to clinical domain.
- E5 â€” Prospective performance + analytical validation: Pre-registered thresholds; prospective AUROC/PPV/NPV; LoD/LoQ, linearity, accuracy, precision, robustness; stability under pre-analytical variation.

## Statistical Validation
- Design:
  - Nested cross-validation; time-based splits for temporal generalization; site-based splits for transportability.
  - Strict leakage controls (patient/encounter grouping; pipeline fit isolation).
- Metrics:
  - Discrimination: AUROC, AUPRC (with prevalence reporting), pAUC where clinically relevant.
  - Calibration: Brier score, reliability curves, ECE; decision-curve analysis for net benefit.
  - Robustness: Bootstrap CIs; sensitivity to preprocessing/assay batch; subgroup parity metrics.
- Multiple testing:
  - FDR control (BH/BY); hierarchical testing for families; permutation-based nulls for small-N.
- Model reliability:
  - Stability selection; ensembling with variance decomposition; SHAP consistency checks under perturbations.

## Bias and Drift Controls
- Confounding and imbalance: IPTW/CBPS; matched analyses; negative/positive control outcomes.
- Batch and platform effects: ComBat/limma; RUV; anchor-based harmonization; replicate guards.
- Temporal drift: Rolling window evaluation; population shift diagnostics; recalibration policies.
- Site effects: Federated leave-one-site-out validation; hierarchical models with site random effects.

## Biological Validation
- Orthogonal assays: Protein vs transcript; imaging vs functional; CRISPR rescue where applicable.
- Pathway and cell-context: Consistency with cell-type localization; receptorâ€“ligand plausibility; directional pathway alignment.
- Knowledge integration: Evidence aggregation from curated sources; conflict resolution with provenance tracking.

## Analytical Validation (Assay Readiness)
- LoD/LoQ determination; linearity across dynamic range; precision (repeatability/reproducibility); accuracy vs reference method.
- Pre-analytical robustness: Stability under storage/handling; freezeâ€“thaw; matrix effects; interference testing.
- SOPs and QC: Controls/standards; run acceptance criteria; traceability and lot tracking.

## Clinical Translation Readiness
- Decision threshold selection via decision-curve analysis; PPV/NPV at clinical prevalence; utility-weighted metrics.
- Prospective design templates: Enrichment strategies; sample-size/power for binary/continuous endpoints.
- Safety monitoring: Continuous surveillance; fairness auditing across subgroups; alerting and rollback.

## Regulatory Mapping (FDA/EMA)
- Biomarker qualification: Context-of-use definition; analytical/clinical validation alignment.
- Documentation: Protocols, audit logs, data lineage, model cards, performance reports.
- Change management: Versioning; impact assessment; post-market surveillance.
