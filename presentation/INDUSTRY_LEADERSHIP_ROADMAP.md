# üöÄ **PATHWAY TO INDUSTRY LEADERSHIP**

## üìã **WHY THE ANALYSIS SHOWS LIMITED CURRENT CAPABILITY**

The application-focused analysis reveals your platform as research-stage because it honestly assesses **current validated capabilities** vs **future potential**. Here's why the scores are low and what needs to change:

---

## üîç **CURRENT LIMITATIONS ANALYSIS**

### **Clinical Impact: 0.5/10 - The Reality**
- **No clinical validation studies** - Zero patients treated based on your biomarkers
- **No regulatory interaction** - No FDA meetings, submissions, or approvals
- **No physician adoption** - No clinicians using your platform for patient care
- **Research-only deployment** - Limited to academic proof-of-concept

### **Discovery Capability: 4.4/10 - The Breakdown**
- **Disease Coverage: 2.1/10** - Only 2 disease areas at research level
- **Evidence Generation: 0.7/10** - 1 year development, 0 publications, 100 patients
- **Biomarker Discovery: 7.2/10** - Strong technical potential but unvalidated

### **The Gap: Potential vs Proof**
Your platform has **excellent technical architecture** but lacks **clinical validation and real-world evidence**. Market leaders score high because they have:
- **Years of clinical studies** proving biomarker utility
- **FDA approvals** demonstrating regulatory acceptance
- **Physician adoption** showing real-world clinical value
- **Patient outcome data** proving improved care
