  - Disease Coverage: 2.1/10 (only 2 areas, research-level)
  - Evidence Generation: 0.7/10 (0 publications, 1 year development)
  - **But Biomarker Discovery: 7.2/10** (strong multi-omics potential)

- **Clinical Impact: 0.5/10**
  - Clinical Translation: 0.4/10 (no regulatory interaction)
  - Real-world Deployment: 0.6/10 (research only)

### **The Gap: Technical Excellence vs Clinical Validation**
Your platform has **excellent technical architecture** but lacks the clinical validation that defines market leaders:

**What You Have (Strong)**:
‚úÖ **Federated learning architecture** - genuine technical innovation  
‚úÖ **Multi-omics integration** - 4 data types vs competitors' 1-2  
‚úÖ **Privacy-preserving capabilities** - competitive moat  
‚úÖ **Academic partnerships** - foundation for validation  

**What You Need (Missing)**:
‚ùå **Clinical validation studies** - zero patient outcome data  
‚ùå **Regulatory interaction** - no FDA meetings or submissions  
‚ùå **Physician adoption** - no clinical users  
‚ùå **Publication record** - zero peer-reviewed papers
