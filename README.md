⸻

Knowledge Graph

The knowledge graph (KG) is the platform’s memory and hypothesis engine. It encodes typed nodes (genes, cell states, pathways, ligands/receptors, tissues, clinical outcomes) and directed relations with provenance and uncertainty. The KG serves four roles:
1) regularization and priors for discovery (constrains search toward biologically plausible structures),
2) mechanistic scaffold for avatars (pathway-informed parameters),
3) decision surface for active learning (where uncertainty is most informative), and
4) ledger for evidence across the E0→E5 ladder. See also: `docs/capabilities.md` (Knowledge Graph Integration) and `KG_EXPANSION_SUMMARY.md`.

The spine of the platform: a typed, versioned graph that contains priors from open sources and accumulating, provenance-linked evidence from our analyses.
	•	Entities: donor/patient, sample, cell type/state, ligand–receptor pair, pathway/module, gene/protein/variant, perturbation, device, assay, tissue function, environment (flow/O₂), clinical outcome, medication/exposure.
	•	Relations: causal (interventional support), temporal, co-expression/module membership, cell–cell communication, spatial neighborhood, clinical association, provenance.
	•	Evidence: prior score, posterior updates, uncertainty, direction/sign, cell/tissue context, condition tags, source/license, versioning.

Roles in the pipeline
	•	Prior & constraint for modeling (regularizes causal search and module discovery).
	•	Mechanistic scaffold & parameter priors for digital twins.
	•	Decision surface for active learning (identify high-value uncertainty).
	•	Ledger for biomarker evidence and mediation paths.

⸻

Modeling & Simulation
	•	Representation learning: multimodal contrastive/self-supervised across imaging, function, omics.
	•	Module discovery: WGCNA/hdWGCNA-style modules with KG-derived annotations (cell/neighborhood/pathway).
	•	Causal/dynamic modeling: time-series + interventional graphs; mediation enforcing molecular → function → clinical.
	•	Hybrid mechanistic–ML digital twins: ODE/QSP modules + PBPK/transport; ML surrogates for complex subsystems; donor-conditioned parameters; Bayesian uncertainty; counterfactual simulation.

⸻

Decision & Orchestration
	•	Active learning/Bayesian optimization: choose perturbations (dose/order/timing) that maximize expected causal information and reduce uncertainty.
	•	Model predictive control (MPC): enforce viability/safety constraints while exploring.
	•	Scheduler: resource-aware execution across devices/assays with replication and counterbalancing.

⸻

Biomarker Discovery Pipeline

From features to dossiers: candidates emerge only after passing sequential gates. Pipeline stages:
1) Feature engineering across omics, imaging, and functional assays; strict leakage controls.
2) Association screening with multiple-testing control and temporal precedence checks.
3) Causal/m mediation analysis to ensure effects route through tissue function mediators.
4) Interventional testing on tissue chips (E2) with replication (E3) and random-effects meta-analysis.
5) Clinical validation (E4–E5): transportability (site/time), calibration, decision-curve thresholds, and analytical validation (LoD/LoQ, precision). Outputs a ranked list with an evidence dossier per biomarker (mechanism path, effect sizes, risks, next steps). See: `ENHANCED_VALIDATION_SUMMARY.md`.
	•	Use cases: diagnostic, prognostic, predictive, monitoring, PD markers.
	•	Scoring: causal impact on functional mediators; cross-model/donor replication; clinical association/mediation; assayability; robustness.
	•	Evidence dossier: mechanism path (graph), interventional evidence, replication, clinical mediation, analytical validation, risk/uncertainty, next steps.

⸻

Patient Avatars & Personalization

Hybrid mechanistic–ML twins are calibrated per donor/patient to reproduce functional readouts (e.g., TEER, MEA) under observed perturbations. They enable counterfactual simulation (virtual dosing, timing, combinations), identification of patient-specific biomarkers, and risk-aware decision support. Avatars tie clinical recommendations to mechanism by attributing predictions to pathway-level parameters. See: `docs/next_win_personalized_biomarkers.md`.

A donor-specific hybrid twin calibrated to that donor’s functional and omic trajectories; outputs personalized predictions and unique markers with path-level attribution.

⸻

Evidence Ladder & Validation

We formalize rigor with E0→E5. Each level requires predefined criteria and quantitative thresholds. Candidates that fail promotion are recycled with targeted experiments chosen by the active learner. This creates a closed loop where negative results increase knowledge value (by pruning causal hypotheses) and positive results accelerate clinical translation. Details: `ENHANCED_VALIDATION_SUMMARY.md`, `docs/benchmarks.md`, `docs/methodology_metrics.md`.
	•	E0: Correlation only
	•	E1: Temporal precedence + module linkage
	•	E2: Interventional causality in vitro
	•	E3: Cross-model & cross-donor replication
	•	E4: Clinical association + mediation via function
	•	E5: Prospective predictive performance + analytical validation
	•	Analytical validation: LoD/LoQ, linearity, precision, robustness.
	•	Biological validation: orthogonal assays, rescue experiments, donor hold-outs.
	•	Transportability: explicit checks from in-vitro to clinical domain.

⸻

Governance & Privacy
	•	Consent tracking; provenance & audit; PHI minimization; federated training for multi-site learning; license-aware KG edges; version pinning (KG vX.Y, pipelines vA.B, dataset releases).

⸻

KPIs & Dashboards
	•	Discovery velocity (cycles/week, info gain/experiment)
	•	Causal clarity (fraction of edges with interventional support; mediation effect sizes)
	•	Robustness (cross-donor/model replication)
	•	Translatability (AUROC/PPV on clinical endpoints)
	•	Operations (assay pass rate; cost per E3/E4 candidate)

⸻

Initial 90-Day MVP
	•	Scope: 1 disease area; 2 model systems (e.g., perfused organoid + tubular tissue).
	•	Assays: functional + imaging + targeted scRNA + secretome.
	•	Modeling: single mediation path; one digital-twin module (transport + simple signaling); basic active learner.
	•	Clinical link: one OMOP site, retrospective mediation.
	•	Output: 5–10 ranked candidates at E2–E3 with dossiers + a working avatar for ≥3 donors.

## Glossary

### 🔬 **Core Concepts**
- **Functional mediator** — tissue-level readout (e.g., TEER, MEA) enforced as the bridge from molecular state to clinical outcome.
- **Digital twin (avatar)** — donor-specific hybrid mechanistic–ML model calibrated to that donor's functional/omic trajectories.
- **Evidence ladder** — progression from correlation → interventional causality → clinical mediation → prospective validation.
- **KG** — typed, versioned graph encoding biology, context, priors, and live evidence with uncertainty and provenance.

### 🧬 **Biomarker Types**
- **Diagnostic** — identifies current disease state or condition
- **Prognostic** — predicts future clinical outcomes
- **Predictive** — forecasts response to specific treatments
- **Monitoring** — tracks disease progression or treatment response
- **Pharmacodynamic (PD)** — measures drug mechanism and effect

### 🎯 **Validation Levels**
- **E0: Correlation** — Statistical association only
- **E1: Temporal** — Time-ordered precedence with module linkage  
- **E2: Interventional** — Causal evidence from in-vitro perturbations
- **E3: Replication** — Cross-model and cross-donor validation
- **E4: Clinical** — Clinical association with functional mediation
- **E5: Prospective** — Prospective validation with analytical rigor

### 🔧 **Technical Terms**
- **TEER** — Trans-epithelial electrical resistance (barrier function)
- **MEA** — Multi-electrode array (electrophysiology)
- **OMOP** — Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (data standard)
- **PBPK** — Physiologically-based pharmacokinetic modeling
- **QSP** — Quantitative systems pharmacology
- **CRISPRi/a** — CRISPR interference/activation for perturbations

### 📊 **Analytics & AI**
- **Causal Discovery** — Automated identification of cause-effect relationships
- **Federated Learning** — Distributed ML training without data sharing
- **Active Learning** — Intelligent experiment design to maximize information gain
- **Uncertainty Quantification** — Systematic assessment of prediction confidence
- **Multi-modal Fusion** — Integration of diverse data types (omics, imaging, function)
