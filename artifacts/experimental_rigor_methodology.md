# Experimental Rigor Comparison: Scoring Methodology Report

## Overview
This report documents the methodology used to score AI drug discovery platforms across five key capability dimensions. Scores are based on publicly available information, peer-reviewed publications, clinical trial data, and company reports.

## Scoring Dimensions

### 1. Experimental Integration (20% weight)
**Definition**: Depth of wet-lab automation and validation workflows integrated into the AI pipeline.

**Scoring Criteria**:
- **10**: Fully automated high-throughput experimental platforms (e.g., robotic screening, automated synthesis)
- **8**: Strong partnerships with experimental facilities or moderate automation
- **6**: Some experimental validation capabilities
- **4**: Limited experimental partnerships
- **2**: Primarily computational with minimal experimental validation

### 2. Mechanistic Understanding (25% weight)
**Definition**: Ability to provide causal inference and mechanistic explanations vs. pattern recognition.

**Scoring Criteria**:
- **10**: Physics-based or mechanistic models with causal inference
- **8**: Knowledge graph approaches with biological reasoning
- **6**: Deep learning with some mechanistic constraints
- **4**: Standard ML with limited interpretability
- **2**: Pure pattern recognition or correlation-based approaches

### 3. Clinical Translation (25% weight)
**Definition**: Success in advancing candidates to human trials and regulatory approval.

**Scoring Criteria**:
- **10**: Multiple FDA-approved programs or advanced clinical trials
- **8**: Several programs in Phase II/III trials
- **6**: Multiple Phase I programs or strong clinical partnerships
- **4**: Limited clinical programs or early-stage trials
- **2**: Pre-clinical focus with minimal clinical translation

### 4. Data Scale (15% weight)
**Definition**: Breadth and depth of training/validation datasets.

**Scoring Criteria**:
- **10**: Comprehensive multi-modal datasets (proteome-wide, etc.)
- **8**: Large-scale multi-omics integration
- **6**: Substantial disease-specific datasets
- **4**: Moderate datasets with some integration
- **2**: Limited or single-modality datasets

### 5. Validation Throughput (15% weight)
**Definition**: Speed and volume of experimental confirmation and validation.

**Scoring Criteria**:
- **10**: Ultra-high throughput (millions of experiments)
- **8**: High throughput validation capabilities
- **6**: Moderate throughput with systematic validation
- **4**: Limited throughput, selective validation
- **2**: Minimal experimental validation capacity

## Validation and Limitations

### Data Sources
- Company annual reports and SEC filings
- Peer-reviewed publications in Nature, Science, Cell
- ClinicalTrials.gov database
- FDA drug approval database
- Partnership and collaboration announcements

### Limitations
1. **Information Asymmetry**: Public companies provide more detailed metrics than private ones
2. **Temporal Variations**: Scores represent capabilities as of September 2024
3. **Weighting Subjectivity**: Dimension weights reflect biomarker discovery priorities
4. **Binary Scoring**: 1-10 scale may not capture nuanced capability differences

### Validation Approach
1. **Cross-Reference**: Multiple sources used for each capability score
2. **Industry Benchmarking**: Scores calibrated against known industry leaders
3. **Expert Review**: Methodology reviewed against academic literature
4. **Conservative Bias**: When uncertain, lower scores assigned to maintain credibility

## Update Schedule
This scoring methodology should be updated:
- **Quarterly**: For clinical trial progression and new partnerships
- **Annually**: For comprehensive capability reassessment
- **Event-Driven**: For major acquisitions, publications, or regulatory approvals

## Conclusion
The scoring provides a transparent, evidence-based comparison of AI drug discovery capabilities. While subjective elements exist, the methodology prioritizes publicly verifiable metrics and conservative estimation to maintain analytical rigor.
