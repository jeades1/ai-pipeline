# Enhanced Visuals: Comprehensive Improvements Report

## Overview
This report documents the comprehensive improvements made to address the three key issues raised:

1. **Enhanced Conceptual KG**: Added edge type indicators and relationship visualizations
2. **Demo Performance Fix**: Created precision analysis plot and enhanced biomarker table
3. **Pipeline Overview Alignment**: Redesigned to reflect original "I want" statements

## 1. Enhanced Conceptual Knowledge Graph

### Improvements Made:
- **Edge Type Visualization**: Added 5 distinct edge styles with visual indicators
  - Causal relationships: Thick solid lines (3.0 width) with closed arrowheads
  - Regulatory relationships: Dashed lines (2.5 width) for control/regulation
  - Structural relationships: Dotted lines (2.8 width) for encoding/formation
  - Process relationships: Medium solid lines (2.2 width) for involvement
  - Evidence relationships: Thin dashed lines (1.5 width) for measurement

- **Relationship Labels**: Added text labels on key edges showing relationship types
- **Dual Legend System**: 
  - Color-coded legend for relationship categories
  - Line style legend for edge type indicators
- **Enhanced Layout**: Expanded canvas (16x12) for better visibility

### Files Updated:
- `tools/plots/enhanced_visuals_v2.py` (complete rewrite)
- `artifacts/pitch/enhanced_conceptual_kg.png` (regenerated)

## 2. Demo Performance Analysis

### Issue Identified:
- AKI markers found (5/8 = 62.5% recall) but ranked poorly:
  - HAVCR1: Rank 721
  - LCN2: Rank 1054  
  - CCL2: Rank 1475
  - CST3: Rank 1737
  - TIMP2: Rank 2815
- Average rank: 1,520 (out of 2,969 genes)
- This causes Precision@K = 0.0 across all K values

### Solutions Implemented:

#### A. Enhanced Biomarker Table
- **Before**: Only showed novel genes at top
- **After**: Prominently displays found benchmark markers with ranks
- Shows both benchmark status and ranking performance
- File: `artifacts/pitch/aki_biomarker_table.tsv` (updated)

#### B. Precision Analysis Plot
- **Dual visualization** showing:
  1. Current vs Target Precision@K performance
  2. Current ranking positions with improvement zones
- **Clear problem statement** and solution requirements
- **Target metrics**: Move 3-4 markers to top 100 for P@K > 0.03
- File: `artifacts/pitch/precision_analysis.png` (new)

### Performance Improvement Recommendations:
1. **Ranking Algorithm Enhancement**: Weight known biomarkers higher
2. **Feature Engineering**: Add biomarker-specific features
3. **Transfer Learning**: Use external biomarker databases
4. **Ensemble Methods**: Combine multiple ranking approaches

## 3. Pipeline Overview Redesign

### Original Issue:
- Generic pipeline stages without clear connection to user requirements
- Missing feedback loops and continuous learning elements
- No alignment with original "I want" statements

### Redesign Approach:
- **Capability-Focused Architecture**: Each stage represents a core "I want" capability
- **Explicit "I want" Labels**: Connected stages to original requirements
- **Enhanced Feedback System**: Multiple feedback loops with clear visualization
- **Functional Flow**: Shows how capabilities enable each other

### New Architecture:

#### Core Capabilities (aligned with "I want" statements):
1. **INPUT INTEGRATION**: "I want to integrate diverse data sources"
   - Multi_Omics_Data, Clinical_Records, Literature_Knowledge

2. **KNOWLEDGE BUILDING**: "I want to build a knowledge graph"  
   - Knowledge_Graph, Biological_Priors, Causal_Inference

3. **BIOMARKER DISCOVERY**: "I want to discover novel biomarkers"
   - Biomarker_Discovery, Ranking_Algorithm, Validation_Prioritization

4. **CLINICAL TRANSLATION**: "I want clinical translation"
   - Clinical_Validation, Experimental_Design, Treatment_Guidance

5. **CONTINUOUS LEARNING**: "I want feedback loops and iterative improvement"
   - Performance_Monitoring, Model_Refinement, Knowledge_Updates

#### Enhanced Feedback Loops:
- **Performance Feedback**: Clinical validation → Performance monitoring → Algorithm improvement
- **Knowledge Feedback**: Treatment outcomes → Knowledge updates → Graph enrichment  
- **Data Feedback**: Performance monitoring → Data collection guidance
- **Cross-layer Integration**: Multiple interconnections showing true integration

### Visual Improvements:
- **Larger Canvas** (18x14) for comprehensive view
- **Curved Arrows** for feedback loops (distinguishable from forward flow)
- **Color-Coded Capability Groups** with clear legends
- **"I Want" Statement Integration** in group labels
