# Codebase Cleanup Summary

## Files Removed

### Completely Empty Files (0 bytes)
- `tools/__init__.py` - Empty package marker, no longer needed
- `tools/cli/__init__.py` - Empty package marker, no longer needed  
- `tools/cli/fetch_encode_atac.py` - Empty stub file
- `modeling/personalized/api.py` - Empty placeholder file
- `modeling/personalized/engine.py` - Empty placeholder file
- `src/kg/__init__.py` - Empty package marker

### Deprecated Files
- `tools/plots/kg_schema.py` - Deprecated plotting module (comment indicated replacement with kg_config.py and pitch_figures.py)

## Files Retained

### Valid Package Markers
- `tools/priors/__init__.py` - Valid package marker with comment, directory has 9+ Python modules
- `kg/__init__.py` - Valid package marker with docstring, directory has 7+ Python modules  
- `src/report/__init__.py` - Valid package marker, directory has builder.py module

## Impact
- Removed 7 files that served no functional purpose
- No broken imports (verified none of the removed files were being imported)
- Maintained all functional code including the complete Personalized Biomarker Discovery Engine
- Preserved proper Python package structure where directories have actual content

## Repository Status
- All 8 components of Personalized Biomarker Discovery Engine remain intact and functional
- Codebase is now cleaner without empty stub files or deprecated modules
- Ready for continued development and lab validation phase
