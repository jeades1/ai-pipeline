This page has moved. Please see the canonical document:

- [ENHANCED_VALIDATION_SUMMARY.md](./ENHANCED_VALIDATION_SUMMARY.md)

If you landed here from an older link, the summary document includes:
- Evidence ladder (E0â€“E5) criteria and acceptance thresholds
- Statistical validation (splits, metrics, calibration, multiple testing)
- Biological and analytical validation (LoD/LoQ, precision, robustness)
- Clinical translation readiness and regulatory mapping
